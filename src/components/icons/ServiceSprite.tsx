/**
 * The whole icon sprite, in the document exactly once.
 *
 * Three surfaces offer every service — the command palette, the service browser
 * and the icon picker — and each used to inline its own copy of ~300KB of
 * `<symbol>` markup. Open the palette over the browser and the document held
 * two copies of every id; open the picker as well and it held three. Duplicate
 * ids are invalid, and the second copy was never the one being drawn from:
 * `<use href="#i-…">` resolves against the document, not against the nearest
 * `<svg>`, which is what made the per-panel copies unnecessary in the first
 * place.
 *
 * Mounted outside React's tree, because the panels that need it come and go
 * independently and none of them owns it. The last one to close takes it away.
