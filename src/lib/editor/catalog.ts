 * The service catalogue, queried.
 *
 * The browser and the icon picker ask the same question of the same 572
 * services — one cloud at a time while browsing, every cloud at once while
 * searching — and each answered it with its own copy of the same thirty lines.
 * Both copies shared a flaw: a relevance rank was computed and then thrown away
 * by sorting every section alphabetically, so searching `lambda` could file the
 * exact match three sections below a service that merely mentions it.
 *
 * Here the ranking survives. Alphabetical order is right for browsing, where
 * the reader is scanning for a name they may not know; it is wrong for
 * searching, where they have already said what they want.
